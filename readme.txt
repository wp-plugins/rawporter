Stand out by using photos and videos to attract more traffic. Now you can tell us exactly what photos and videos you need and our army of cameras will capture it for you.  Need footage from a conference you can't attend?  No problem.  Simply assign Rawporters in that area to capture it for you.  Want to conduct interviews across the world?  We have Rawporters in over 50 countries, making it easy for you to get the footage you want.

Prices start as low as $5, and all our videos are automatically time, date, and location stamped so you know they're credible.  

Here's how it works:

* Add assignment description
* Set price as low as $5
* Add photos or videos to blog post


Yep. It's that simple.
